# Machine-Learning
Welcome to the repository for machine learning practicals! ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š Here, we engage in practical, hands-on machine learning exercises. Making machine learning work for real-world issues is more important than just theorising. You can find a number of useful projects and code samples that will walk you through the creation, training, and application of machine learning models in this repository.
